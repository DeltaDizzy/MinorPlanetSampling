# Minor Planet Sampling
### Have you ever wondered why Squad added comets and a Rosetta recreation but required kerbals to do any science at either them or asteroids? 
### Wouldn't it be nice to have a reason to send missions to asteroids earlier on in the game, to add value other than mining or proving you can capture one? 
Minor Planet Sampling aims to solve this by allowing unkerballed spacecraft to perform the surface sampling experiment that comets and asteroids are equipped with! Due to technical reasons and modding effort required, the vessel doing the collection *must* have a part onboard that can act as a science container, so the Breaking Ground sample arms and the stock surface ore scanner have been given the ability to store one experiment.

## Dependencies (none included)
- ModuleManager
- HarmonyKSP
- KSP 1.10.0 or later

## Installation
### Option 1. CKAN (heavily recommended)
Open CKAN, search for "Minor Planet Sampling", click the checkbox to the left, and click the green checkmark on the top of the window.
### Option 2. Manual
To install, open the MinorPlanetSampling.zip file and merge the GameData folder inside it with your KSP install's GameData folder. I will not devote a lot of time to troubleshooting manual installs, if you run into trouble just use CKAN.

## Changelog
- v1.0 (August 9th, 2023)
  - Added comet experiment
  - Added required science container functionality
 
## Roadmap
- Add asteroid experiment
- Remove the need for science containers?
